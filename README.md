# UCL-2021-22-Dashboard

This project is an UEFA Champoins League 2021-22 dashboard. I used Microsoft SQL Server to write queries and visualized them using Power BI. In the end, I had three main sheets. Some of the charts I had in mind didn't fit, so I decided to add several additional sheets that can be switched between using buttons. Thus, the dashboard consists of:

1. Key Statistics, where general key information is gathered, along with one additional sheet containing an extra chart;
2. Club Statistics, where statistics for each club are compiled, along with three additional sheets with charts;
3. Player Statistics, along with one additional sheet containing a chart.
